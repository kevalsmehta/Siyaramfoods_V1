# Siyaram Foods — Static Website

This is a plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript website for `siyaramfoods.in`.

## Files
- `index.html` — complete website
- `styles.css` — responsive design
- `script.js` — menu + product filters
- `assets/logo.jpg` — your uploaded Siyaram Foods logo

## Product images
The product cards use the same product-image URLs from the reference Siya Foods website. They are loaded from `siyafoods.com` at runtime.

If you have permission to use those images, you can later download them into `assets/products/` and change the `<img src>` paths to local files. This makes the website independent of the old domain.

## Before publishing
1. Replace `info@siyaramfoods.in` with your actual enquiry email if different.
2. Add your actual phone/WhatsApp number and factory address.
3. Replace any placeholder company wording with your final legal/company details.
4. Upload the folder contents to your hosting for `siyaramfoods.in`.

The design is inspired by the structure of the reference site, but the Siyaram Foods branding and page styling are original.


## Version 2 updates
- Changed the site's green accent palette to blue.
- Added a product-photo corner mask to hide the old Siya Foods watermark visible on the supplied reference product images.
- Siyaram Foods logo remains unchanged.


## Product image note
The product cards no longer reference Siya Foods images. They now use clean product photos hosted by third-party sites. Because these images are third-party assets, confirm licensing/permission before using them commercially. For the safest final website, replace them with Siyaram Foods-owned or licensed product photographs.


Update: Spices are now included directly inside the main Products section as product cards (Turmeric, Red Chilli, Cumin, Coriander, Mustard and Fennel). The separate Spices section has been removed.
Some spice photos are from third-party/public image sources; confirm licensing before commercial publication.


## Enquiry email functionality
The Contact / Send Enquiry form is configured to submit all entered details to `info@siyaramfoods.in` using FormSubmit's AJAX endpoint. On the first live submission, FormSubmit may send a one-time activation/confirmation email to the receiving address; complete that activation before relying on the form for production enquiries.

For production use, the site must be hosted on a normal HTTPS domain. If you prefer not to use a third-party form service, the same form can instead be connected to your hosting provider's PHP/Node mail service or an SMTP provider.


Original Siyaram Foods product image update (October 2026)
- Replaced product-card image sources with original generated product imagery, featuring bowls, clean studio backgrounds, and Siyaram Foods branding in the upper corner.
- Product images are stored locally in assets/products/ and do not load from Swad Foods or other third-party image URLs.
- The generated catalog uses illustrative visual representations; verify each product depiction and brand artwork before commercial publication.

Update note: Product list image references have been adjusted so each product card uses a different image file. Please review product/image matches before publishing.


PRODUCT IMAGE CORRECTIONS (October 2026)
Product cards have been rebuilt to remove mismatched image/name pairs. Products with no matching image have been removed from the list. The supplied official Siyaram Foods logo is overlaid on each product image. Product categories follow the Swad Foods reference categories, but photos are local original/previously provided assets, not copied from Swad Foods.


PRODUCT IMAGE UPDATE (October 2026)
- Removed the Siyaram Foods logo from every product image (it was baked into each JPG and also overlaid with CSS). The CSS overlay has been deleted.
- Replaced White Onion Flakes, White Onion Chopped, Garlic Flakes and Garlic Chopped with the supplied product photos, shown in the same wooden bowl style as the rest of the set, with matching product-name labels.
- Pink Onion Flakes was rebuilt in the same bowl style (the old file had the logo on top of the product); file renamed to pink-onion-flakes.jpg.
- Removed unused images that contained logo/contact text (garlic.jpg, white-fine.jpg, white-pieces.jpg).
- Fixed product-card CSS so the full image is shown instead of being cropped.


ENQUIRY FORM (updated)
The "Send Enquiry" button now tries, in order:
 1. send-enquiry.php  - upload this file next to index.html on PHP hosting (cPanel/shared hosting).
                        It emails info@siyaramfoods.in directly. Edit $TO / $FROM at the top if needed
                        ($FROM should be an address on your own domain, e.g. noreply@siyaramfoods.in).
 2. FormSubmit.co     - backup. ONE-TIME SETUP: submit a test enquiry from the live https site, then open the
                        "Activate Form" email FormSubmit sends to info@siyaramfoods.in and click the button.
                        Until activated, FormSubmit will not deliver anything.
 3. mailto fallback   - if both fail, the visitor's email app opens with the enquiry pre-filled, so no enquiry is lost.
Note: the form cannot send when index.html is opened as a local file; test it on the live website.
